# Kartikâ€™s AMR Project Tracker (18 Weeks)
**File:** `AMR_project.md`  
**Owner:** Kartik Mehta  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28  
**Scope:** STM32 low-level control, Jetson Nano high-level compute, motor drivers, current sensing (ACS758 x2), FreeRTOS, ROS2 + Gazebo, SLAM & Navigation.

## Status Summary
- Overall: On track with tuning in progress
- Progress: 6/18 weeks complete (~33%)
- Current Focus (Week 7): Firmware v2 scaffold, PWM @20 kHz, encoder TIM3, ADC current sensing (ACS758) bring-up
- Next Focus (Week 8): E-stop input + safety interlock; current telemetry + basic current limit
- Timeline: Flexible (plan extended beyond 18 weeks). Prioritize firmware + ROS; Custom PCB is low priority/optional.
 - Firmware Branching: v1 (bench, L298N + small encoder) is now frozen; all new work proceeds in v2 (Cytron MDD20A + post-gearbox encoder).

Legend: Done (âœ“), In Progress (â—), Partial (â—’), Planned (â—‹), Blocked (â– )

> Canonical view rule: If the table and task board ever conflict, the table wins for schedule; task board wins for day-to-day details.

## Detailed Tasks
The granular task board has been moved to docs/AMR_firmware_tasks.md to keep this file focused on high-level goals and the weekly schedule.

Status: See the “Status Summary” above and task-by-task statuses in docs/AMR_firmware_tasks.md.

## Definitions of Done (per milestone)
- PID tuning (W7): SSE â‰¤ 5%, overshoot â‰¤ 10%, no sustained oscillation, documented plots & gains.
- E-stop (W8): Latched E-stop with immediate PWM cutoff; manual clear; telemetry flag; test report.
- Dual-motor (W11): Straight-line < 2 cm drift over 5 m; in-place turn â‰¤5Â° error.
- FreeRTOS (W13): Tasks meet deadlines under load; CPU < 70%; no missed watchdog.
- Validation (W16): E-stop latency â‰¤ 50 ms; current-limit interaction stable under step loads.
- SLAM demo (W18): Successful nav in mapped area for â‰¥ 15 min without collision or watchdog resets.

## Metrics
- Control quality: SSE, overshoot, rise/settling time (from logs)
- Reliability: E-stop latency, fault counts/day, watchdog resets
- Throughput: Control loop jitter, CPU utilization (RTOS)
- Power: Peak & average current draw, brownouts
- Delivery: Lead time per milestone, tasks closed/week

## ROS2 Architecture (Draft)
- Nodes
  - `mc_interface` (micro-ROS on STM32): subscribes `/amr/wheel_cmd`, `/amr/estop`; publishes `/amr/wheel_state`, `/amr/obstacles`
  - `odometry`: subscribes `/amr/wheel_state`; publishes `/odom`, `/tf`
  - `safety_monitor`: subscribes `/amr/obstacles`, `/amr/estop`; publishes `/amr/safety_state`
  - `sensor_fusion`: fuses proximity/LiDAR/depth; publishes `/amr/obstacles`
  - `teleop` or higher-level commander: publishes `/cmd_vel` or `/amr/wheel_cmd`
  - `sim_bridge`: interfaces Gazebo topics with AMR topics
- Topics (proposed)
  - `/amr/wheel_cmd` (geometry_msgs/Twist or custom wheel velocities)
  - `/amr/wheel_state` (sensor_msgs/JointState)
  - `/amr/obstacles` (sensor_msgs/Range[] or custom)
  - `/amr/estop` (std_msgs/Bool), `/amr/safety_state` (std_msgs/UInt32)
  - `/odom` (nav_msgs/Odometry), `/tf`, `/tf_static`

## Docker Development Environment (Draft)
- Images/containers
  - Firmware build: arm-none-eabi toolchain, micro-ROS build tools
  - Jetson runtime: ROS2 base, micro-ROS agent, AMR nodes
  - Desktop dev: ROS2, Gazebo, build/test tools
- Compose
  - `agent`, `ros-core`, `sim`, `tools` services; volumes for logs and bags
- CI integration
  - Build, lint, test stages; multi-arch where needed
```

## Issues & Backlog (triage labels)
- P0 block progress today
- P1 needed for this milestone
- P2 nice to have / future

```text
[P1] Plot script: generate step response graphs from CSV (rise time, overshoot, SSE)
[P1] Telemetry v2: add fault flags + setpoint
[P2] CLI: live Bode-like sweep tool using chirp
```

## Risks & Mitigations
- Current spikes trip supply â†’ Add soft-start/ramp; validate with current logs.
- Encoder noise at high RPM â†’ Add digital filter/debounce; verify with scope.
- Thermal on motor driver â†’ Heatsink & airflow in enclosure; current derating logic.
- RTOS timing regressions â†’ Watchdog + scheduler tests; CI to replay step tests on logs.

## Decision Log (append entries)
```
YYYY-MM-DD â€” Switched to Cytron MD30C
Context: L298N thermal + dropout issues
Options: L298N, MD10C, MD30C
Decision: MD30C for current headroom
Consequences: Redesign mount; add airflow
```

## Change Log
- 2025-10-28: Marked Week 2 ADC as skipped; set Week 8 next focus to E-stop feature; added Final Drivetrain Migration step; noted flexible timeline and PCB as optional.
